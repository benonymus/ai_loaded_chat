# AiLoadedChat

Experimental chat experience with AI overload.
You can converse with AI.
You can enchance your own messages.
You can generate an (ugly) avatar with AI. (Slow depending on the hardware available, and uses a lot of RAM.)

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
